Small tools I use in everyday work

`sshhost.py` - tool to fast search in ssh config. There are moments when someone just tell me host IP and I don't remember its config name, so each time I need to grep it from config. This tool allow to do so by just giving to it a part of anything return whole information about needed host if such exists in config.
